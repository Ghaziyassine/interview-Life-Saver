## 🚀 Overview

**Interview-Life-Saver** is a desktop productivity tool and overlay manager built with Electron. It allows you to display real-time, interactive, or static content on top of your screen without triggering detection from applications like coding test platforms (HackerRank, CodeSignal), video calls, or screen recording software.

Whether you're building an internal assistant, testing anti-cheat systems, or presenting complex workflows with non-invasive overlays, this tool has you covered.

## 🎯 Purpose

- ✅ Display real-time info (like AI suggestions, references, or instructions) without disrupting focus.
- ✅ Ensure overlays are not captured in common screen shares or recordings.
- ✅ Provide a hidden UI layer for internal tools or automation.
- ✅ Useful for:
  - Interview platforms testing
  - Screen-share-based demos
  - Competitive programming
  - Productivity overlays
  - Developer assistant UIs

## 🛡️ How Screen Share Protection Works

The application uses the Windows API function `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` to hide its window from screen sharing and recording tools. This functionality is currently available **only on Windows**.

For more technical details and API usage, refer to the [Window Utils Native Addon README](native-addon/window-utils/README.md).

#### Key Details:

1. **API Used**:
   - The `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` function is part of the Windows API.
   - The flag `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` is used to make the window invisible to screen capture tools.

2. **Implementation**:
   - A native C++ addon was created to interact with the Windows API.
   - The addon exposes functions like `setWindowDisplayAffinity`, `resetWindowDisplayAffinity`, and `getWindowDisplayAffinity` to JavaScript via Node.js bindings.
   - These functions are called from the Electron main process to apply the display affinity settings to the app's window.

3. **Behavior**:
   - When `setWindowDisplayAffinity` is called with the `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` flag, the window becomes invisible to screen sharing and recording tools like Zoom, Teams, and OBS.
   - The window remains visible to the user directly on their screen.

4. **Integration**:
   - The native addon is integrated into the Electron app and controlled via IPC commands from the renderer process.
   - Users can toggle the screen capture protection on or off using the app's UI.

This approach ensures that the app's window is hidden from all screen sharing and recording tools while remaining fully functional and visible to the user.
